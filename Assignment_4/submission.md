## Survey Questions
##### How much effort did you give for the assignment?
Combined effort between group members was nearly 25 hours.

##### How many lines of code did you have to write?
Approximately 237, including comments.

##### Rate the difficulty in 1-10 scale (easiest to hardest)
7

##### To understand reuse and amortization, first count the total lines you reused from Assignment #3, and how many more did you write? What percent reuse did you get? Was it seamless (if not, what changes had to be made)?

We reused 1102 lines from the previous assignment and added 237 more to complete the docker implementation. We had 82.3% reuse. The majority of changes were related to modifying the implementation structure to interface with the necessary dockerfiles. Changes were otherwise 'seamless'.
